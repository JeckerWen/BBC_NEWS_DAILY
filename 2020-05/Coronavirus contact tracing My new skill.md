**It could be the most important job of our times. And now, after receiving a 95% pass rate in my final exam, I can proudly say, I am a qualified contact tracer.**

**`这是我们这段时间最重要的工作。最近我在最终的测试的通过率为95%，我能很自豪的说我是个合格的跟踪者。`**

​	What is not clear is just how well trained most of the people **undertaking** this vital task in the UK will be.

​	`不清楚是，在英国**承担**这项重大任务时，有多少人愿意配合。`

​	A contact tracer does the **detective** work of calling up people known to be infected with a disease and working out where they have been in recent days and who they might have met.

​	`一位追踪者的任务是召集已感染的人并收集最近几日的活动地点和聚会活动信息。`

​	The idea is then to **track down** those with whom they have been in close **proximity(接近)** and tell them to go into **quarantine**.

​	` 这个主意就是追查与感染者接触亲密的人，并告知其进行隔离。`

​	With the government recruiting 25,000 contact tracers to be at the heart of its new test, track and trace strategy, we wanted to experience the sort of training they will receive.

​	`政府召集了25,000名跟踪者作为新型训练、追踪和追踪策略的核心人员，我们想体验这些追踪者的短期训练课程。`

​	Public Health England told us that was not possible - so **instead** I **enrolled(招录)** in the course offered by *America's Johns Hopkins University*, in **conjunction(关联)** with the online training platform Coursera.

​	`但是英国公共卫生部门告诉我们这是不行的-作为代替，我参加了美国约翰霍普金斯大学提供的课程，并与Coursera学习平台的课程结合学习。`

​	The course, which tens of thousands of people have taken, **consists** of a series of video lectures and multiple choice **quizzes(测验)**.

​	`有数万人选择这门课程，这门课程由一系列的视频和多项选择测验构成。`

**It took me an intense eight hours to complete and I emerged with enormous respect for the discipline.**

> **我花费了8个小时完成了这项课程，并非常尊重这项学科**

​	As the lecturer put it on the very last page: "contact tracing is a complex activity which requires attention to detail and problem-solving skills".

> 正如这门课程最后所说的那样:“密切的跟踪是一项复杂的活动，它需要关注细节并需要解决问题的技巧”

​	What became clear, is that although technology such as the Bluetooth apps being tested around the world can help, human skills are vital.

> 显而易见的是，尽管诸如有像蓝牙apps等遍布全球技术提供帮助，但人类的技巧也是至关重要的

​	The final section - which took me two hours to complete - is all about how you talk effectively to the people you are trying to help.

> 我用了两个小时去完成课程的最后一部分，其主要内容是关于如何有效的告诉他人你该如何向他提供帮助。

​	So, what did I learn?

> 那么，我学习到了什么呢？

### Lessons learned 学习到的内容

​	I know much more about the signs and **symptoms(症状)** of the disease - for example, that a loss of taste and smell is reported by around a third of all patients, **despite** [the UK only just adding this](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52704417) to the **recognised(公认的)** list of symptoms.

> 我学习到了很多关于感染会出现的症状，比如，尽管约有三分之一的患者称他们失去了味觉，但英国政府只将该症状列入了公认的症状名单中。`

​	I have learned that of all the places where the disease can spread most easily, [care homes, where vulnerable people are in close contact](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52284281), are right at the top of the list.

> 我了解到所有存在感染者的区域病毒非常容易扩散，养老院是易感区域中最严重的地方。

​	I now know more about the difference between isolation and quarantine - although the US and UK **guidelines(指导)** are not the same.

> 现在我知道了"隔绝"和"隔离"两者的不同，尽管美国和英国的指导方针并不相同。

​	But the key message is how small the window is to alert people who may have been in contact with the **infection(感染)**, before they spread it further - and so how **swiftly(迅速地)** contact tracers need to act.

> 该图的关键信息是告知与患者接触过得人员在病毒进一步传播之前，应该立刻与跟踪人员联系并采取隔离措施，图上的小窗口是需要隔离的时间。

​	The **slide(滑动)** below tells the story:

> 下面的幻灯片讲述了这样一件事：

​	Once someone has been in contact with an infected person, there are five days of **incubation(孵化,潜伏)** before they themselves may become infectious - so it is vital that they receive a warning as quickly as possible.

> 一些人接触已经感染的人，在他们可能确认感染五日潜伏期内，最重要的是尽快警告他们。

​	Stephanie Hare, a data **ethicist(论理学家)** who also took the course, says the other lesson the UK could learn is how important speedy testing is.

> 数据伦理学家Stephanie Hare也参加了这门课程，她说英国的另一门课程是快速测试的重要性。

​	"Unfortunately, the United Kingdom does not have a testing capability that would allow our population at scale to report symptoms on the first day we experience them, get tested, and get the result back within 24 hours," she said.

> "不幸的是，英国并没有检测当天出现症状的人是否感染的能力，检测并在24内获得检测报告"，Stephanie Hare说。

### Communication 社区

​	Having learned a lot about Covid-19 and the **principles(原则)** of contact tracing, the course then took me through the process of making a call to someone who had either received a positive test or been in contact with someone infected with the virus.

> 学习到了不少关于新冠和追踪知识后，课程还教会了我和做过核酸检测的人和感染者的联系过程

​	There was great **stress(强调)** on the importance of communicating clearly, but also on establishing a rapport with people receiving worrying news.

> 要着重强调交流的重要性，也要建立收到不好消息的人们的关系。

​	We met **poor(可怜的)** Larry with the hacking cough and then Annette, the **choir(合唱团)** member he had probably infected.

> 我们与可怜的犯着干咳的Larry和Annette进行了交流，作为合唱团成员的他可能已经感染了病毒。

​	We **admired(钦佩)** the **empathy(同情)** shown by tracer Amy - "I hear you, this is a difficult time" - while **chuckling(咯咯笑)** at the **brusque(粗暴)** **ineptitude(无能)** of her colleague Drew, who kept interrupting and upsetting Larry and Annette.

### Ethics 伦理

​	Any contact tracers employed in the UK will be dealing with some very sensitive information, often working from home on their own computers.

> 受任与英国的追踪者需要经常在家通过电脑处理一些敏感性的问题。

​	The Johns Hopkins course **outlines(轮廓，概述)** the ethical challenges involved in contact tracing.

> Johns Hopkins的课程概述了在追踪过程会涉及到的伦理性问题。

​	The **quiz(测验)** at the end of the section **featured(精选)** some easy questions: if your subject tells you that one of his recent contacts was his girlfriend, should you tell his wife? Err, no.

> 在最后精选部分测验时有一些简单的问题："你的联系对象告诉你他最近接触的人有一个是他的女朋友，你应该告诉他的妻子么？"嗯..，当然不。

​	But what about the contact telling you she had spent a lot of time in a pub where you know your friends and family hang out?

> 但是如果你的联系对象告诉她经常在一家酒吧，而您知道你的朋友和他的家人在外面闲逛。

​	You cannot tell them they may be in danger, said the **instructor(教官)**.

> 指导员的答案是你不能告诉他们已经处于危险状态了。

### Technology 技术相关

![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/C3F1/production/_112416105_gettyimages-1216351064.jpg)

​	While this course is about old-fashioned **manual(手册)** contact tracing - the technique used to **combat(战斗)** the **Ebola(埃博拉)** **outbreak(爆发)** and other **epidemics(流行疾病)** - it does also run through some of the technology tools which could help.

> 虽然课程讲老版本的手册讲的是与埃博拉病毒和其他流行疾病战斗的技术，但是其中一些技术方法对抗击新冠也有所帮助。

​	These include the Bluetooth contact tracing apps currently being developed in a number of countries, including the UK.

> 包括英国在内的许多国家已经应用了蓝牙联系人跟踪apps技术。

​	Given the small window available to trace contacts, it says automating the process could make it faster and more effective. But there is also a warning that such apps need high take-up to be effective - and should be **integrated(集成)** with the testing and public health systems, meaning contacts get calls from a human tracer as well as pings on their phones.

> 提供的小窗口可以自动、快速高效的用于联系人跟踪。但需要注意的是，该应用需要高度的推广使用，并需要接入检测信息和公共卫生系统，意味着需要获得人们手机的联系人信息和信号信息。

​	So for all the talk about privacy being **baked(植入)** into apps, users could still end up getting a call from a tracer asking some deeply personal questions.

> 因此关于隐私的信息会植入近apps，用户可能会接到追踪者的一些电话，并会被询问一些深层次的个人问题。

​	Overall, the course gives a detailed and **inspiring(鼓舞)** but also **realistic(现实)** view of what contact tracing can achieve.

> 总体而言，该课程对联系人跟踪的具体实现进行了详细、充满启发性且现实的看法。

​	In normal **circumstances(情况)**, out of lockdown, someone with Covid-19 will infect between two and three other people.

> 一般情况下，解除封锁令，患有新冠病毒的人会一传二，二传三。

​	If that can be reduced to just one person then the epidemic could be brought under control.

> 如果减少至一人，则可以对其进行控制。

### How does it compare with the UK? 与英国相比，如何呢？

​	There have been reports that the training process for new contact tracers in the UK is pretty **sketchy(粗略)** - a few PowerPoint slides and some scripts for callers to follow.

> 有报道称英国在对追踪者培训是相当粗略的。并提供了相关PPT和脚本信息。

​	Isabel Oliver, who is **overseeing(监督)** the contact tracing programme for Public Health England, told me she was not familiar with the Johns Hopkins course but was happy with how recruits here were being trained.

> 英国公共卫生部的联系人跟踪项目监督人员Isabel Oliver告诉我，她不熟悉Johns Hopkin的课程，但是她开心有人帮助如何培训新人员。

​	"Our training is based on the requirements for our own programme," she said.

> "我们的培训是基于我们的项目需求"，Isabel Oliver说到。

​	"We're very confident that we've got a good and **robust(强大的)** system in place. It's been tried and tested."

> "我们已经有一个已经通过测试和使用过的很棒很强大的系统，我们对其非常有信心"。

​	**Originally(本来，原来)** the government **indicated(指示)** that the Bluetooth contact tracing app currently being tested on the **Isle(小岛)** of Wight would be key to efforts to control the virus once lockdown was eased.

> 原先政府的指示是一旦接触封锁，在Wight岛上蓝牙联系人追踪技术将是控制病毒的关键手段。

​	Now it is clear that an army of human contact tracers will be first into battle, so the quality of their training will be crucial.

> 显然，现在的陆军联系人跟踪者将会第一时间投入战斗，而训练的质量将成为关键。
