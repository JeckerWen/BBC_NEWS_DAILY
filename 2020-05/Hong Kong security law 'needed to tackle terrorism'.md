​		John Lee said the city had become "**shrouded(笼罩)** in the shadow of violence".

​		After months of quiet, this weekend saw a fresh **surge(浪涌)** of **protest(抗议)** after the government in Beijing proposed a security law which would **radically(根本地)** change Hong Kong's unique status.

> 经过几个月的宁静，在中国政府在北京提出了会改变香港独特地位的安全法后，这周香港迎来的新的一轮抗议潮。

​		Opponents say it is a direct attempt to limit freedoms and silence critics.

> 反对者说，这安全法将直接尝试去限制人身自由权和自由言论权。

​		The bill was put forward on Thursday as China's **parliament(议会)**, the National People's Congress (NPC), met for its delayed annual **gathering(搜集)**.

> 这项法案是在这周四人已经进行推迟后的人大会议上提出的。

​		China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, said the **legislation(立法)** - which would ban "**treason(叛国)**, **secession(分裂)**, **sedition(煽动)** and **subversion(颠覆)**" - should be brought in "without the **slightest(丝毫)** delay".

> 中国外交部长王毅说这次立法绝不容忍“叛国”，“分裂”，“煽动”和“颠覆”分子，已经“没有丝毫缓和的余地”。

> 安保局局长李家超说：“在过去的一年里，暴力事件不断升级，很多案件涉及到炸药和真正的枪支”。

​		"Terrorism is growing in the city and activities which harm national security, such as 'Hong Kong independence', become more **rampant(猖獗)**."

> 这座城市的恐怖主义活动正在升级并危害着国家安全，“港独分子”越来越猖獗。

​		He said the **clashes(冲突)** on Sunday showed "the need and **urgency(紧急)** of the decision to be **deliberated(商榷)** by the NPC" and that the law would ensure Hong Kong's "long-term prosperity and stability".

> 李宗翰说到上周的冲突事件说嘛：“现在急需人大会议商榷这项法案”，这项法案能确保香港“长期繁荣稳定”。

​		The **Commissioner(专员)** of Police Chris Tang also welcomed the bill, saying weapons and explosives **seized(没收)** from protesters showed Hong Kong was "at the risk point of national security and there is a need to take effective measures to prevent the situation from **deteriorating(恶化)**".

> 警务处处长Chris Tang也非常赞同这项法案，从'黄尸'缴获的装备和炸药已经说明：“国家已经处于危险的边缘，需要采取有效的方法避免情况继续恶化”

### What is in China's proposed law? 中国提出的法案是什么？

​		Under Hong Kong's Basic Law - the mini constitution in place since it went back under Chinese rule in 1997 - it largely has responsibility for its own internal affairs and security.

> 自香港于1997年回归后颁布的“基本法”，其内容是最大限度的保证香港内部事务自治和安全。

​		But the "**draft(草案)** decision" - as it is known before **approval(认可)** by the NPC - includes an article that says Hong Kong "must improve" national security.

> 而“草案”中一处指出香港“必须改善”国家安全。

​		It adds: "When needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People's Government will set up agencies in Hong Kong to **fulfil(履行)** relevant duties to safeguard national security in **accordance(按照)** with the law."

> 另外：“当香港有需要时，中央人民政府相关国家安全部门会按照法律，代理香港政府履行相关责任以保卫国家安全。”

​		That means China could potentially have its own law **enforcement(强制执行)** agencies in Hong Kong, **alongside(旁边)** the city's own.

> 该法律意味着中国可以直接强制对香港进行代理。

​		A group of 200 senior politicians from around the world have **issued(发起)** a joint statement criticising China's plan.

> 由全球200名政客组成的团体已经对中国的这项计划发出联合声明以表示谴责。

​		**US Secretary of State(美国国务卿)** Mike Pompeo also **condemned(谴责)** the plans, describing them as a "death **knell(葬钟)**" for the city's freedoms. The UK, Australia and Canada have also expressed their "deep concern".

> 美国国务卿Mike Pompeo也对这项计划进行了谴责，并将其称为城市自由的“葬钟”。英国，澳大利亚和加拿大也其表示“深切担忧”。
